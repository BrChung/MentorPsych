You are being asked to take part in a research study (CareerFair.ai: Increasing Connections to Fast-Growing STEM Careers) carried out by Drs. Yuko Okado and Benjamin Nye. This consent form explains the research study and your part in it, if you decide to join the study. Please read the form carefully, taking as much time as you need.  

If you have any questions, or if there is anything you don’t understand, please send an email to Dr. Okado (yokado@fullerton.edu) and wait for clarification before proceeding. You can decide not to join the study. If you join the study, you can change your mind later and leave the study at any time.  There will be no penalty if you decide to not take part in the study. 

What is this study about? 

This research study is being conducted to help develop a web-based, career guidance platform (CareerFair.ai) that provides college students with a way to learn about STEM-related careers by having simulated conversations with real-life mentors.

The study involves a pre-test survey (approximately 10 minutes), followed by interaction with the CareerFair.ai website (approximately 30 minutes). The session will conclude with a post-test survey (approximately 15 minutes). 

You cannot take part in this study if you are under the age of 18 years.

What will I be asked to do if I am in this study? 

If you take part in the study, you will be asked to:

	•	Take a pre-test survey at the beginning of the study 
    (approximately 10 minutes). You will be asked to complete 
    questionnaires about your demographic background and
    career interests. 

	•	Visit the CareerFair.ai website and interact with its 
    virtual mentors for 30 minutes. The interaction will 
    simulate conversations with real-life professionals from 
    STEM on topics related to training and career development.

	•	Take a post-test survey at the end of the study 
    (approximately 15 minutes). You will be asked to provide 
    detailed feedback on your user experience with the
    CareerFair.ai website and complete questionnaires on 
    career interest and knowledge.

The pre-test and post-test surveys will not be connected to your name or
 other identifying information. You can refuse to answer any question you 
 don’t want to answer.

 Are there any benefits to me if I am in this study?

 The potential benefits to you for taking part in this study are: 

	•	Experience of interacting with a new virtual mentoring 
        platform;

	•	Experience of participating in – and learning about – 
        research processes in an online psychology study;

	•	Increased awareness of training and career pathways in 
        STEM.

 Are there any risks to me if I am in this study? 

The potential risks from taking part in this study include: 

	•	​Physical fatigue (e.g., eye strain, hand discomfort) 
        associated with completing questionnaires and 
        interacting with the CareerFair.ai webpage on a 
        computer and/or a mobile device; 

	•	Boredom;

	•	Interception of personal information due to breaches
        in Internet security, though every effort is made to
         minimize the collection of identifying information, 
         and questionnaire or survey responses are removed 
         from identifying information.

Will my information be kept anonymous or confidential? 

The data for this study will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by 
law. No published results will identify you, and your name will not be associated 
with the findings. Under certain circumstances, information that identifies you may 
be released for internal and external reviews of this project. 

Throughout the study, you will be assigned a confidential user identification (ID).
 Your responses to surveys will be connected to this ID, not to your actual name or 
 other identifying information. Your contact information (name and email address) 
 will be used to verify your participation and assign research credit on the CSUF 
 Psychology Department Research Pool website, if applicable, but will not be connected 
 to your responses. Only the principal investigator (Dr. Okado) and trained research assistants will have access to your contact information, and they will access and use 
 this information only to the extent necessary for administering this study (e.g., 
 assigning research credit on the research pool). 

 How will the data from this study be stored and used?

 Data will be stored on password protected servers and computers. Only the researchers 
that need to use the data will have access, and only the principal investigator 
(Dr. Okado) will have access to your full contact information. Trained research 
assistants may get access to your name and email address so that they can assign 
research credit. 

The results of this study may be published or presented at professional meetings, but
 no identifying information will be disclosed. Thus, all research participation will 
 remain confidential.

 The data for this study will be kept indefinitely. Data may be used for future
 research projects, conference presentations, and publications.

 Are there any costs or payments for being in this study?  There will be no cost to
 you for taking part in this study.

If you are participating in the Psychology Department Research Pool, you will earn 
1 credit for:

	•	Competing the pre-test survey;

	•	Interacting with the CareerFair.ai website for 30 
        minutes – the website will log your usage using your 
        anonymous user ID to verify active use for the 
        30-minute period; and

	•	Completing the post-test survey.

Research participation will be verified and credit assigned within 1 week of your study completion.

If you are not participating in the Psychology Department Research Pool, there is no compensation.  We hope that you will enjoy interacting with the CareerFair.ai website and find it useful, and we appreciate your providing feedback to help improve student outreach.
 
You will not receive money or any other form of compensation for taking part in this study.
